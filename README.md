TODO: Write a project description

## Installation

### Prerequisite software
To download this game one must have the following software installed:
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

Other dependencies that come when you run npm install
- [Bower](http://bower.io/)
- [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)
- [yargs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yargs)

### Compilation
- Run the command "Git clone https://github.com/DavidWatkins/Walking-in-Their-Shoes.git" in a directory you want to download the project to
- Run "cd Walking-in-Their-Shoes"
- Run "npm install"
- Run "bower install"
- Run "gulp build"
- The entire project will now be contained in the "Walking-in-Their-Shoes/dist" folder

## Usage

To run the web server, execute the following command: "gulp connect". This will open up a basic http server with node. By default this will open the web server using port 80, if you want to open the web server on a different port use: "gulp connect --port <port>". The game is then accessible from the url: [localhost](localhost)
If you want to use your own custom web server such as Apache, copy the contents from dist into your web folder and point your web server to look in that directory
